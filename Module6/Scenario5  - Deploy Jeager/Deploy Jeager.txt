Deploy Jeager

After installing Istio, it's easy to setup Jeager as an Istio add-on.

To view metrics data from containers in the pod we must install addons in the cluster. The following addons can be added here.
*	grafana
*	Jaeger
*	Kiali
*	Prometheus

Tip: Inside the istio folder, we have a folder called samples. Inside samples find the addons folder to view all addons.

12- To install all addons use the following command
*	kubectl apply -f istio-1.9.0/samples/addons

13- Confirm new pods for addons are created. We should see a pod called istio-tracing
*	kubectl get pod -n istio-system

14- Run the following command to see the Jeager service deployed
*	kubectl get service -n istio-system

15- Jeager service should be deployed as a clusterIP service so we can make it availabe through localhost
*	kubectl port-forward svc/Jeager-query -n istio-system 16686
*	Copy 127.0.0.1:16686 to your browser to see the web interface

16- Continuesly connect to your web application and refresh to get some tracing data
