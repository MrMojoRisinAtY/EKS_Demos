Setup Network Policy using Calico

1- Install Calico

2- Verify Calico is running
*	kubectl get ds -A

3- Verify you have access to your publicly accessible nginx service
*	kubectl get service nginx -n web

4- Copy the value of the External-IP and paste it in browser. You should see the nginx welcome page

5- Apply a network policy to deny traffic to all objects in the web namespace
*	kubectl apply -f deny-all-traffic.yaml

The deny-all traffic.yaml file looks like the following

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
  namespace: web
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress

6- Load the nginx page and see that it fails now

7- Create a second network policy to allow network traffic to the nginx pod
*	kubectl apply -f allow-external-web-access.yaml

The allow-external-web-access.yaml config file looks like the following

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: nginx-allow-external
  namespace: web
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - port: 80
    from: []

8- Load the nginx page and see that it now works again
